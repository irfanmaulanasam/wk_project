        <h1 class="title">Marley's Ghost</h1>
        <h2 class="lead">
          Marley was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that.
          The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Nellie, a cruising yawl, swung to her anchor without a flutter of
          the sails, and was at rest. The flood had made, the wind was nearly
          calm, and being bound down the river, the only thing for it was to
          come to and wait for the turn of the tide.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of
          an interminable waterway. In the offing the sea and the sky were
          welded together without a joint, and in the luminous space the tanned
          sails of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in
          red clusters of canvas sharply peaked, with gleams of varnished
          sprits. A haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in
          vanishing flatness. The air was dark above Gravesend, and farther back
          still seemed condensed into a mournful gloom, brooding motionless over
          the biggest, and the greatest, town on earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Director of Companies was our captain and our host. We four
          affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to
          seaward. On the whole river there was nothing that looked half so
          nautical. He resembled a pilot, which to a seaman is trustworthiness
          personified. It was difficult to realize his work was not out there in
          the luminous estuary, but behind him, within the brooding gloom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Between us there was, as I have already said somewhere, the bond of
          the sea. Besides holding our hearts together through long periods of
          separation, it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other’s
          yarns—and even convictions. The Lawyer—the best of old fellows—had,
          because of his many years and many virtues, the only cushion on deck,
          and was lying on the only rug. The Accountant had brought out already
          a box of dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones.
          Marlow sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the mizzen-mast. He
          had sunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back, an ascetic
          aspect, and, with his arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards,
          resembled an idol. The director, satisfied the anchor had good hold,
          made his way aft and sat down amongst us. We exchanged a few words
          lazily. Afterwards there was silence on board the yacht. For some
          reason or other we did not begin that game of dominoes. We felt
          meditative, and fit for nothing but placid staring. The day was ending
          in a serenity of still and exquisite brilliance. The water shone
          pacifically; the sky, without a speck, was a benign immensity of
          unstained light; the very mist on the Essex marsh was like a gauzy and
          radiant fabric, hung from the wooded rises inland, and draping the low
          shores in diaphanous folds. Only the gloom to the west, brooding over
          the upper reaches, became more sombre every minute, as if angered by
          the approach of the sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          And at last, in its curved and imperceptible fall, the sun sank low,
          and from glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without
          heat, as if about to go out suddenly, stricken to death by the touch
          of that gloom brooding over a crowd of men.
        </p>
        <p>
          Forthwith a change came over the waters, and the serenity became less
          brilliant but more profound. The old river in its broad reach rested
          unruffled at the decline of day, after ages of good service done to
          the race that peopled its banks, spread out in the tranquil dignity of
          a waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth. We looked at
          the venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes
          and departs for ever, but in the august light of abiding memories. And
          indeed nothing is easier for a man who has, as the phrase goes,
          “followed the sea” with reverence and affection, than to evoke the
          great spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the Thames. The
          tidal current runs to and fro in its unceasing service, crowded with
          memories of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the
          battles of the sea. It had known and served all the men of whom the
          nation is proud, from Sir Francis Drake to Sir John Franklin, knights
          all, titled and untitled—the great knights-errant of the sea. It had
          borne all the ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night
          of time, from the Golden Hind returning with her rotund flanks full of
          treasure, to be visited by the Queen’s Highness and thus pass out of
          the gigantic tale, to the Erebus and Terror, bound on other
          conquests—and that never returned. It had known the ships and the men.
          They had sailed from Deptford, from Greenwich, from Erith—the
          adventurers and the settlers; kings’ ships and the ships of men on
          ‘Change; captains, admirals, the dark “interlopers” of the Eastern
          trade, and the commissioned “generals” of East India fleets. Hunters
          for gold or pursuers of fame, they all had gone out on that stream,
          bearing the sword, and often the torch, messengers of the might within
          the land, bearers of a spark from the sacred fire. What greatness had
          not floated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of an unknown
          earth!… The dreams of men, the seed of commonwealths, the germs of
          empires.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sun set; the dusk fell on the stream, and lights began to appear
          along the shore. The Chapman light-house, a three-legged thing erect
          on a mud-flat, shone strongly. Lights of ships moved in the fairway—a
          great stir of lights going up and going down. And farther west on the
          upper reaches the place of the monstrous town was still marked
          ominously on the sky, a brooding gloom in sunshine, a lurid glare
          under the stars.
        </p>
        <p>
          “And this also,” said Marlow suddenly, “has been one of the dark
          places of the earth.”
